Solving Burgers equation using Python

Burgers equation which is a combination of convection-diffusion equations was solved with simple initial conditions

Burgers equation : ∂u/∂t + u.∂u/∂x + v.∂u/∂y = nu.(∂2u/∂x2 + ∂2u/∂y2)

Spatial domain : X ∈(0,2)
		 Y ∈(0,2)
		  
Initial Conditions : setting u = 3 between 0.75(x,y) and 1.25(x,y)  as the I.C.s

Boundery Conditions : u= 1 for x=0, 2 
      		      u= 1 for y=0, 2
